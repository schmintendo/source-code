## This fork has an already compiled .hex for convenience, as well as adjustments to the default keymap for use in "osu!".

Changes:
* Bongo cat animation, modified from the popular [Kyria keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/kyria/keymaps/j-inc/keymap.c)
* Rotary encoder changed from volume up/down to mouse scroll wheel up/down
* Debug mode turned off
* different layer indicators on the OLED
* got rid of the function layer, replaced it with an "osu" layer
